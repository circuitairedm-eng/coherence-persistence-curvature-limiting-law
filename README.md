# coherence-persistence-curvature-limiting-law
Reasoning — whether done by a human, a transformer, or even a group of people arguing — is never about creating meaning from scratch at every step.
It is about taking one coherent thought and repeatedly transforming it into the next coherent thought, while keeping the core meaning alive.
Think of it like passing a single glass of clear water from cup to cup down a long line of people.
If every person just pours the water into the next cup without spilling or adding mud, the water at the end is still recognizably the same water, even though it has been moved 100 times.
That is what successful reasoning looks like inside the model: the same “glass of meaning” is carefully handed from token to token.
What makes the hand-off possible at every step?
Coherence.
Each new token is forced to be compatible with everything that came before it. That constraint is the invisible thread that keeps the original meaning from leaking away.
When the reasoning is going well, two things happen that you can literally feel when you read the chain-of-thought:
1.  The cloud of possible ideas gets narrower and sharper (the model stops wandering; everything starts pointing at the same small set of concepts).
2.  The main concepts become clearer and stand out more against the background noise (they are reused and reinforced instead of being abandoned).
That sharpening + reinforcing is exactly what the Ricci curvature and the persistence numbers were measuring. They are just extremely sensitive rulers for “how much did the cloud of meaning squeeze and clarify itself this step?”
But the rulers are not the point. The point is the universal mechanism:
Reasoning = repeated coherent transformation of the same core meaning.
Coherence is the force that both preserves the meaning and refines it at the same time.
This works at every scale because it doesn’t depend on the substrate.
It happens in:
•  a 400-billion-parameter LLM doing math
•  a human writing an essay paragraph by paragraph
•  a team whiteboarding a proof over days
•  two people having a focused conversation
•  even evolution “reasoning” across generations (mutations have to stay coherent with the existing organism)
Whenever you have symbols (words, equations, DNA bases, whatever) and a pressure to stay coherent with the past, the same sharpening dynamic appears.
